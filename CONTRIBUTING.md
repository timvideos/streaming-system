## Contribution Guidelines

There are many ways to contribute to a project:

* documentation
* testing
* coding
* reviews
* bug reports

Regardless of what type of task you pick, here are some general guidelines
to follow.

## Organizing Work

Before you get started, remember that it is easier to accept pull
requests that are narrow in scope and easy to review. Ideally we want to see
pull requests with changes that are limited to one issue. It's best not to
have unrelated commits and changes in a pull request. Plan out your
work in this fashion.

When committing a change, please make a descriptive comment about the
change, and please include the issue number in your commit comment.
This helps us track the progress in the related issue. This works like so:
  
    $ git commit CONTRIBUTING.rst -m 'added new contributing documentation for #53'

## Documentation

Contribute and test documentation. We could always use more documentation and
we could always use improvements to the existing documentation. For example,
The viewpoint of someone just joining a project is immensely valuable.
If you are a just starting, follow the documentation for getting started.

Any time something is missing or inaccurate, take notes on it. Consider submitting
a pull request to improve the documentation, or opening an issue about the
missing documentation with details on what is missing.

## Task Selection

Some of the project issue trackers have helpful labels that guide contributors
towards tasks. Look at labels for guidance. If the labels are not clear, talk
to us.

## Bug Reports

Report bugs in a project's issue tracker.

If you are reporting a bug, try to include:

* Any details about your local setup that might be helpful in troubleshooting.
* Detailed steps to reproduce the bug.
